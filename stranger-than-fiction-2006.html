<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Stranger Than Fiction movie review (2006)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Harold begins to hear a voice in his head, one that is describing his own life -- not in advance, but as a narrative that has just happened. He seeks counsel from a shrink (<a href=#>Linda Hunt</a>) and convinced he is hearing his own life narrative, seeks counsel from Jules Hilbert, a literature professor (<a href=#>Dustin Hoffman</a>). Hilbert methodically checks off genres and archetypes and comes up with a list of living authors who could plausibly be writing the "narration." He misses, however, Kay Eiffel (<a href=#>Emma Thompson</a>), because he decides Harold's story is a comedy, and all of her novels end in death. However, Eiffel is indeed writing the story of Harold's life. What Hilbert failed to foresee is that it ends in Harold's death. And that is the engine for the moral tale.</p><p>Meanwhile, an astonishing thing happens. Harold goes to audit the tax return of Ana Pascal, a sprightly, tattooed bakery shop owner (<a href=#>Maggie Gyllenhaal</a>) and begins to think about her. Can't stop thinking. Love has never earlier played a role in his life. Nor does she much approve of IRS accountants.</p><p>How rare, to find a pensive film about the responsibilities we have to art. If Kay Eiffel's novel would be a masterpiece with Harold's death, does he have a right to live? On the other hand, does she have the right to kill him for her work? "You have to die. It's a masterpiece."</p><p>But life was just getting interesting for Harold. The shy, tentative way his relationship with Ana develops is quirky and sideways and well-suited to Gyllenhaal's delicate way of kidding a role. He doesn't <i>want </i>to die. On the other hand, after years of dutifully following authority, he is uncertain of his duty -- and he is so meekly nice, he hates to disappoint Eíffel. Harold himself has never done anything so grand as write a masterpiece.</p><p>Although the obvious cross-reference here is a self-referential <a href=#>Charlie Kaufman</a> screenplay like "<a href=#>Adaptation</a>," I was reminded of another possible parallel, Melville's famous short story "Bartleby the Scrivener," made into the 2001 movie with <a href=#>Crispin Glover</a> and <a href=#>David Paymer</a>. Bartleby is an office drudge who one day simply turns down a request from his boss, saying, "I would prefer not to." Harold Crick, like Bartleby, labors in a vast office shuffling papers that mean nothing to him, and one day he begins a series of gentle but implacable decisions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46sq6uZnpyys3nToZinZZaesLW1zqdka2hgaw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-riele-downs-pregnant-baby-bump-and-weight-gain-rumours.html><span>←</span><span>Is Riele Downs Pregnant?
