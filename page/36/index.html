With John HornsbyThe song came and went
Like the times that we spent
Hiding out from the rain
Under the carnival tent
I laughed and she'd smile
It would last for awhile
You don't know what you got

Listen to the mandolin rain
Listen to the music on the lake
Oh, listen to my heart break
Every time she runs away
Oh, listen to the banjo wind</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Austin Moody Age, Wiki, Biography Net Worth, Jennifer Waynes Husband, Wedding: 10 Facts</h2><time>May 18, 2024</time>
