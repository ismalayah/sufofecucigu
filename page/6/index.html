Walsh thought of the part as a modern spin on the kinds of parts Sidney Greenstreet used to play, but Greenstreet was good company, even when playing bastards.

Out on his own, he's hitching through Vermont when he comes upon a spaced-out mother (Kelly Lynch) and her worried young daughter; their car has broken down.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Your thoughts on the Galar region?</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>
