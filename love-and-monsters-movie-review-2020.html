<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>Love and Monsters movie review (2020)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Later on, Joel meets two more charming souls, who add character to the saga and not much else. But they share a good comedic chemistry, with Joel still as the clumsy underdog, who learns from the tough-as-nails kid Minnow (<a href=#>Ariana Greenblatt</a>) about how to fire a crossbow, and Clyde (<a href=#>Michael Rooker</a>) the secrets of surviving day by day. During their travels, Michaels spikes the goofiness with a few tense moments, not so much from grand surprise, but a festering dread. Especially as Joel’s flashbacks to seven years ago depict a gruesome end to everyone's loved ones, “Love and Monsters” has a vital sense of danger, mixed with its interest in using O’Brien for some frantic slapstick.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>The script by <a href=#>Brian Duffield</a> and <a href=#>Matthew Robinson</a> (with story credit to Duffield) staples together its adventure using voiceover and a whole batch of characters' good timing, but O’Brien’s Joel is a strong guide: he's optimistic, excitable, and always likable. O’Brien helps give the movie a heart, and creates the movie’s need for connection in ways beyond finding his dream girl—he shares an unexpectedly sweet scene with a talking robot, which gives a sense of gravity that helps the later moments when he’s sprinting from an appropriately freaky centipede. “Love and Monsters” has a winning sincerity that helps it move along, even if you become more aware of just how narrow it is.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Underneath everything, “Love and Monsters” has the feeling of a director auditioning for something of a “<a href=#>Transformers</a>” movie, especially in its third act. The final showdown feels like a&nbsp;tacked-on calling card, but it’s another smoothly executed set-piece of people scrambling during a monster attack, with some hand-to-hand combat thrown in the mix. It’s also a good moment for the film’s sporadic use of practical effects, when all of the crags, slime, and moss on a monster makes them seem even larger in close-up, something you just don’t get from the other CGI creatures that chase people around in this story.&nbsp;</p><p>But even more than for director Matthews, this is O’Brien’s showcase. He makes you believe that Joel is&nbsp;sprinting for his life from some fantastic beasts, and that throwing himself into an apocalypse to combat loneliness is noble enough. “Love and Monsters” openly tells you it’s not overthinking a single component, but with the spectacle of O’Brien’s athletic work, that’s not exactly the end of the world.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p>Now available on Premium Video-On-Demand</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46lpq%2BdXZa7pXnMqKWsrJWnwG65zq%2BgnmWimsOqsdZmaWlqYA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-hiddleston-returning-for-season-2-of-his-other-smash-hit-tv-series.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Hiddleston returning for season 2 of his other smash hit TV series</span></a>
