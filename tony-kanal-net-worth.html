As of late 2016, based on authoritative sources it is reported to be $25 million, acquired from his years in the music industry which now spans almost 30 years.</p><h3>Tony Kanal Net Worth $25 million</h3><p>Born in Kingsbury, England, Kanal is the son of Gulab and Lajwanti who were originally from India. The family moved a number of times including living in Toronto, Canada and Munster, Indiana until finally settling in Anaheim, California. During their time in Anaheim, his family opened a gift shop named “Kanal’s Gifts and Fashion”.</p><p>Kanal’s love for music started at an early age when his father bought him a saxophone so that he can learn to play it, as his father was also a player of the instrument. From the saxophone, he eventually transferred to playing and falling in love with the base guitar, when one of his classmates at Anaheim High School taught him to play the instrument. Kanal started to invest more time in music, attending various concerts and eventually joining the band called No Doubt. Despite his dedication to music, his parents still wanted him to go to college, so he enrolled at California State University, Fullerton pursuing a degree in psychology, but it was also during this time that No Doubt’s career started to take off.</p><p>When No Doubt’s bassist Chris Leal decided to leave the band, they held open auditions, and Kanal got the spot. Soon they were writing and recording music and started playing at small events and venues. From a fan to a member, his early years with No Doubt became the start of his professional career in music and also of his net worth.</p><p>In 1990, Kanal and the band got signed with Interscope Records and released a self-titled album in 1992. Although their initial album didn’t attract that much success, the band still continued to promote their music, and focused on creating more records. No Doubt came back with newer materials and later on achieved success; their albums “The Beacon Street Collection” and “Tragic Kingdom” were hits among fans, and introduced the band to a more mainstream audience. They followed it up with more music and later on in 2000 released their album “Rock Steady”, which ultimately helped the band’s and Kanal’s career, and also his wealth.</p><p>When the band went on a hiatus, Kanal continued working in the music industry pairing up with other artists. Some of the musicians he was able to work with included <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a> on her first solo album “Love.Angel.Music.Baby.”, Pink, Elan Atias, Shontelle and Pussycat Doll member Kimberly Wyatts. His various collaborations also helped his net worth in the long run.</p><p>Today, Kanal is still active in the music industry working as a producer and songwriter. He is still an active member of No Doubt, and they still occasionally perform both on television and on tour.</p><p>In terms of his personal life, Kanal previously dated band member <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a> despite the opposition of some of the members. The two broke up but still remained friends and band mates. Today, Kanal is married to Erin Lokits, an actress, and together they have two daughters.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.161538461538><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tony Kanal</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$25 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 27, 1970</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Kingsbury, Harrow, London, United</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.7 m</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Bassist, Record producer, Songwriter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>California State University, Fullerton</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American, British</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Erin Lokitz</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Coco Reese Lakshmi Kanal</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Gulab Kanal, Lajju Kanal</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/TonyKanal</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38888888888889><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/tonykanal</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/tonykanal/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1053988/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tony-kanal-mn0000743168</a></td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Music Groups</td><td>No Doubt, Satellite Party, Don't Speak, Just a Girl, It's My Life</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Album of the Year</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Zoolander, Live in the Tragic Kingdom</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=8><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>His parents opened a store named "Kanal's Gifts and Fashion".</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>2</td><td>He enrolled at California State University, Fullerton to major in psychology.</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>3</td><td>Was ex-boyfriend of singer Gwen Stefani, they went out for 7 years.
