The 51-year-old actress has been very fond of her beloved friend and keeps on gushing about him. However, some sources claim that their friendship has turned into a romantic relationship.</p><p>Horgan and Burgess were spotted kissing each other next to a busy area in London. They were reported to be so lost in each other that they didn’t care about the paparazzi or any possible onlookers. The singer and actress duo kept their relationship private and low-key until then.</p><p>The actress married Jeremy Rainbird, a producer, and they stayed together for fourteen years and had two children. However, they are already separated. She has an eighteen-year-old son Sadhbh and a thirteen-year-old son Amer with her ex-husband. After meeting him at music festivals, she developed a good relationship with singer Burgess.</p><p>However, their meetings weren’t just limited to music festivals. Tim was invited to the set of Divorce, a show featuring Jessica Parker, with Sharon as a writer and producer. In addition, Tim had also tweeted admiring Sharon’s show called Catastrophe.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tim-burgess-and-wife-nik-colk-void-why-did-they-split></span>Tim Burgess And Wife Nik Colk Void: Why Did They Split?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tim Burgess was previously married to Nik Colk Void, a UK-based electronic musician and artist.</p><p>However, they have split and are no more together. The actual reason behind their divorce is yet to be revealed.</p><p>Nik is widely known for her approach to modular systems, voice, and guitar. Nik Colk Void is a very talented artist, and she has an excellent knowledge of experimental shapeshifting and collaboration. She usually plays guitar and Modular Eurorack systems. Her primary focus includes blending compositional tracks and leaning toward techno, club, practical, and noise.</p><p>Nik has played with Factory Floor, the ferociously intense and wildly hyped-up team. The team has created a blend of post-industrial electronic rock and noise, including live techno. She was once spotted by former Throbbing Gristle members Chris Carter and Cosey Fani Tutti and was invited to play live and record with the duo.</p><p>Despite recording three albums as CTV and nine in total with different other collaborators, Void remained unconvinced about releasing her solo work until she was convinced by late Editions Mego Founder Peter Rehberg. She finally set to reformulate her live and studio modular synth patches and created her debut LP called Bucked Up Space.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tim-burgess-and-nik-void-have-a-son-together></span>Tim Burgess and Nik Void have a son together<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tim Burgess and Nik Void have a son named Morgan, who is eight years old.</p><p>The singer has had a pretty bad time for the last few years. He lost his dad in April 2020 and his relationship with the mother of his child, his wife, Nik Void. Burgess has been trying to stay positive, calm, and resilient throughout the worse days of his life.</p><p>Burgess came up with the song “Time That We Call Time,” saying that it was because he wanted to call time on everything. He believes that no matter what, we should always fall in love with the world’s wonder. He also states that he is usually positive because he practices meditation twice daily. He always wants to move forward in life.</p><p>Tim and Void shared a home in rural Norfolk and stayed there with their son Morgan. He attempted home-schooling his son. “I didn’t think I could teach him anything other than how to hold a microphone,” he said.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tim-burgess-new-solo-album-%e2%80%9ctypical-music%e2%80%9d></span>Tim Burgess’ new solo album “Typical Music”<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tim Burgess has released a new solo album, “Typical Music,” recorded at the Rockfield Studios” with collaborators Daniel O’ Sullivan and Thighpaulsandra.</p><p>Burgess had written the whole album during the lockdown. He took six months to complete the entire song. Since there was no touring during the pandemic and lockdown, Tim had his whole focus on writing. He also stated that Simon from Bella Union suggested he begin writing during the transitional phase.</p><p>He first wrote “Time That We Call Time” after struggling for months. However, after that, his writing went with a flow. He didn’t just stop and wrote twenty-two songs in six months.</p><p>According to the singer, all the songs were written on acoustic guitar. There are also hip-hop elements in the music since he wanted to make his album more electronic than the previous one. Tracks including “In May” and “When I see you” portray romance, and there are also some songs about a certain someone, the singer has said. It is mostly about his bonding with his son.</p><p>Besides the album, he will also release the second volume of his “The listening party book.” Burgess hints about the evolution of his Twitter Listening Parties. He stated that he got a sample a couple of days ago, and the first page he opened to was Nirvana, the second one to Blondie, and the following to Yoko Ono and John Lennon.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=some-faqs></span>Some FAQs<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-age-of-tim-burgess></span>What is the age of Tim Burgess?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tim Burgess was born in May 30, 1967 and he is 55 years old as of 2022.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-real-name-of-tim-burgess></span>What is the real name of Tim Burgess?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tim Burgess’ birth name is Timothy Allan Burgess and his stage name is Tim Burgess</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-new-album-of-tim-burgess></span>What is the new album of Tim Burgess?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Tim Burgess has recently released his new album which is called Typical Music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyZonqjwdGgnKyrXZa7pXnSoZirp55itbC%2BxpqlZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLAsbjIrWSwoaSderi1xZ5kp6GbYsOwtcNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./new-look-at-the-flash-unleashes-the-latest-wave-of-ridicule-at-ezra-millers-expense.html><span>←</span><span>New look at The Flash unleashes the latest wave of ridicule at Ezra Millers expense</span></a>
