This is patently incorrect and a reckless statement,” it read. “All individuals charged with a crime are legally presumed innocent until convicted in a court of law. Therefore, it is premature to speculate or discuss what possible sentence would be appropriate or warranted.”</li><li>Tianna’s Civil Rights Attorney Lee Merritt Esq, tells #TheShadeRoom that he believes District Attorney Dan Dow “has been more political in his office than he ought to be,” adding, “He’s using that office for conservative political purposes and I think that’s an extension of that.”</li><li>“I think the charges against her are totally inappropriate. Those charges are only recommendations. She hasn’t been formally charged with anything,” he continued. “It would be on the D.A. to make the determination whether or not he presents those charges to the grand jury, and then the grand jury whether or not they would move forward with indicting her on those charges.”</li><li>At the time of the protest, a driver reportedly assaulted the crowd with their car, and another protester who hasn’t been identified allegedly took a skateboard to the back of the car.</li><li>She is active on social media platforms.</li><li>She is very close to her family members and is a religious lady.</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyZlruvrYyaqZqskWKvra3CpGSloaaawG65wK2rnqpdrLastc%2Bem6KZXZe2sHnAoJxmoJWetKnAjLCcop%2BYqXqktMCrnp6rXZrBqbrInKCtsV2jrrW1zqeYpaGkrnqnrcKtqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-top-10-greta-gerwig-films.html><span>←</span><span>The top 10 Greta Gerwig films</span></a>
