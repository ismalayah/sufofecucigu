There have also been multiple Challenge moments where they solidified their friendship through sacrifices and support.</p><p>It’s no surprise that Cory has continued to play an essential role in his friend’s life outside of reality TV.</p><p>“Me and&nbsp;Cory&nbsp;shed tears together on the phone,” Nelson told <a href=#>People</a>, adding, “He came down here for my birthday. Cory’s been one of my No. 1 supporters.”</p><p>Just recently, Cory and Nelson linked up at Universal Studios Hollywood. Based on an Instagram carousel post, Cory took his family and Nelson to Universal Studios.</p><p>“I wanted to make to sure he could spend some time with the girls before he loses his leg. Outta all my friends, nelson has always been the best with my daughters, and I’m forever thankful for that,” Cory wrote in his caption.</p><p>He also asked others to keep Nelson in their thoughts and prayers ahead of his March 5 amputation surgery.</p><p>“it’s been a long year & he deserves to be happy!! I pray he can finally start to recover On my birthday or not, you know we’ll be praying for you love you brother ✊🏽🙏🏽 & like I always tell you this is the next chapter of your life and it’s gonna be amazing.

He also spoke about how castmate <a href=#>Jordan Wiseley</a> is “one of [his] best friends] and has played an important part in his life.”</p><p>“One thing he did tell me, he said, ‘Nelson, don’t give up. Don’t let this stop you from doing what you want to do in life. Because if there’s a will, there’s a way. I’ve been there. I’ve been doubted, having one hand. My brother’s been doubted. We just have to learn to adapt. It might be hard sometimes, but you can do it,'” he shared.</p><p>In addition to Jordan, Nelson revealed that castmates Chris “CT” Tamburello, Wes Bergmann, and Amanda Garcia are among those who contacted him during his situation.</p><p>As he prepares for his new way of life following his March 5 amputation surgery, he’s also remaining positive and focused on the future. Nelson hasn’t ruled out a return to MTV’s The Challenge either.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He mentioned the importance of his faith and that it is up to God to determine his path.</p><p>Nelson said: “it’s not what I want anymore. It’s what He wants for me,” he said. “And if that opportunity presents itself, heck yeah! If ‘The Challenge’ calls, I would definitely pick up that phone. But I don’t know what He has in store for me.”</p><p>The Challenge: Battle For a New Champion Reunion Part 2 airs Wednesday, March 3 at 8/7c on MTV.
