And I’m like, ‘f–k you.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Game-of-Thrones-Season-Finale-Dany.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Game-of-Thrones-Season-Finale-Tyrion.jpeg><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>Without a doubt, one of the Dragon Queen’s most iconic nude scenes in Game of Thrones came in season 6, when she burns all of the Khals that have captured her, before emerging from the flames unscathed. And though this particular moment received a bit of fan backlash, Clarke’s still proud of the sequence, saying:</p><p>“I was like, I’m owning this. This is mine, they’ve asked me to do it, and do you know what? I’m f****** game.”</p><p data-characters=602 data-current-count=928 data-injectable=false>With Thrones<strong>&nbsp;</strong>now over, it remains to be seen if the actress will continue taking roles that require nudity, but it’s nice to hear that in later seasons of the show she was able to “own” these moments and also had the courage to stand up to those who pressured her early on to do something she might’ve been uncomfortable with at the time. And even despite how the last run of the hit series turned out, <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>&nbsp;will still go down as one of television’s greatest achievements, with Clarke’s performance in particular always being a highlight of each season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymuciloJplk6Gus7fEZqernaOowrOxw2alrpyVYsCksc2eqmafkaKybsDHq6annaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./amy-robach-and-tj-holmes-make-first-public-appearance-since-getting-the-boot-from-gma.html><span>←</span><span>Amy Robach and TJ Holmes make first public appearance since getting the boot from GMA</span></a>
