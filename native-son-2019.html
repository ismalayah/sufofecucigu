<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Native Son movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2019)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span class=s1>Now set in the present day, Wright’s hero, Bigger Thomas (<a href=#>Ashton Sanders</a>) is a young man in need of direction. He works a low-paying job as a bike messenger and the biggest events on his calendar seem to be dinners with his family, running into friends throughout Chicago or meeting up with his cute girlfriend, a hairstylist named Bessie (<a href=#>KiKi Layne</a>). He rocks a metal meets Afro-punk look of green hair, DIY scrawled messages and buttons on his beat-up leather jacket, silver sings on every finger, black nail polish and the skinny pants that make him look even thinner. Like his role as Chiron in <a href=#>Barry Jenkins</a>’ “<a href=#>Moonlight</a>,” Sanders is painfully soft-spoken and meek, at least in the beginning of his saga. His shoulders stay haunched and guarded through much of the movie, as if trying to protect the character’s frail soul. The flashes of indignation and violence that comes later seem almost unthinkable in the character we see at the start of “Native Son.”</span></p><p><span class=s1>Cinematographer <a href=#>Matthew Libatique</a> casts “Native Son” under a gloomy shadow in every frame. The clouds never seem to part, the lightbulbs always seem dim. It’s as if hopelessness follows Bigger through his every waking minute. The only things that break this monotonous gloom are occasional pops of brighter colors. Bigger’s green hair is an excellent standout feature, setting him apart from everyone else in the movie. There are also the vivid blue walls of Bigger’s bedroom at home and graffiti-lined spaces that inject a sense of life into the painful story. As if the overcast cinematography wasn’t ominous enough, the movie’s fatalist tone is driven home by a foreboding score by <a href=#>Kyle Dixon</a> and <a href=#>Michael Stein</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span class=s1>A new job opportunity comes Bigger’s way and he’s thrust into an uncomfortable sphere of privilege. His new employer, a real estate tycoon named Mr. Dalton (<a href=#>Bill Camp</a>), wants to help him out while displacing families like his. The paradox is not lost on Bigger, but he takes the job of driving the Dalton family because he needs the money. Most of his time on the job, at least what’s shown onscreen, involves watching over Mr. Dalton’s spoiled college-aged daughter, Mary (<a href=#>Margaret Qualley</a>), who sneaks off with her politically-minded boyfriend and cajoles Bigger to let her stay out late into the night. Hoping to earn her trust, and not lose his job, he reluctantly goes along with it, until one drug-fueled night where everything goes horribly wrong.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46nmK2hppp6tLvNZmlpaWk%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-is-boxer-jamaine-ortiz-net-worth-2022-his-salary-career-earnings-details.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Is Boxer Jamaine Ortiz Net Worth?
