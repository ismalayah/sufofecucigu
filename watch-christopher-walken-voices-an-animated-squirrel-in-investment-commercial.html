ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, operate like mutual funds, but can be bought and sold on the market like a stock. Their prices fluctuate all day like a stock, unlike a mutual fund that can only be traded after the market closes.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>An ETF is higher risk, but also has lower fees attached.
