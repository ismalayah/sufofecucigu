The character, who is, in comics lore, a product of Tony Stark, may already have roots in the MCU, and her official entrance into the massive cinematic universe is turning heads.</p><h2 id=h-mainframe-in-marvel-comics data-injectable=false>Mainframe in Marvel Comics</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mainframe_alt.jpg><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=500 data-injectable=true>An android styled after Tony’s Iron Man suits in an alternate universe (Earth-982), Mainframe was supposed to be a stand-in for the hero following his retirement. Unwilling to leave the world unprotected in his absence, Tony created Mainframe to carry on his legacy — and largely succeeded. The Mainframe included in the MCU is thoroughly removed from the Marvel Comics character, but her inclusion in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 could see her get a far more expansive role in Vol. 3.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Mainframe technically enjoyed her MCU debut back when Guardians Vol. 2 arrived, but her role was minor enough to be easily missed. She got a tiny nod in one of Vol. 2‘s post-credits scenes, as one of the Ravagers seek to rejoin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stakar Ogord’s crew</a>. Her single line was largely lost to the background — and other, more enticing post-credits scenes — but her inclusion in&nbsp;Vol. 3 has fans praying for a much more robust Mainframe presence.</p><p data-characters=693 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>The fully-robotic character would certainly be a tempting ally for the Guardians. Her comics counterpart, which is referred to as male but is technically genderless, comes equipped with superhuman strength and the ability to fly, along with a range of high-tech weapons including missiles, laser beams, and sophisticated sensors. He’s also all but indestructible, thanks to his memory core’s ability to transmit itself to an alternate body upon heavy damage. If Mainframe is ever damaged beyond repair, his consciousness and memories will transmit to a carefully stored alternate cyborg, where it will download everything that makes Mainframe who he is into a fresh, unmarred body.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who plays Mainframe in the MCU?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Mainframe_MCU.jpg><p data-characters=660 data-current-count=960 data-injectable=false>The vocal talent behind Mainframe saw a change between Guardians Vol. 2 and 3. Her brief appearance in the second film saw the character utter a single line —&nbsp;“I missed you guys so much!” — which was just enough to get audiences hooked. That line was spoken by Miley Cyrus, but the musical superstar won’t be returning to the MCU <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">for Vol. 3</a>. Instead, the role was shifted into the capable hands of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an existing MCU staple</a> who’s already proven herself to be a fan favorite. Mainframe’s disembodied Vol. 3 voice comes courtesy of none other than Tara Stong, known (and loved) for bringing Loki‘s Miss Minutes to life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTpLqqr8GopqSrX6y1sHnIrGSmmZmjs7OtzJ5koqZdqbWmecyaqa%2BdnGLCr7XVnqmsnV2Wu6V51qGmZq6fnrCmv4yhnKtlmaN6qMHAq5uimZ6oerCyjK2fnmWXlrmixNhmraikXWh8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rick-valenzuela.html><span>←</span><span>Rick Valenzuela movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</span></a>
