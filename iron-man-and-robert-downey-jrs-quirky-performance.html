<span>Martina Birk</span></p><h1>&amp;quot;Iron Man&amp;quot; and Robert Downey Jr.'s quirky performance | Roger Ebert</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>There are some things that some actors can safely say onscreen, and other things they can't. The Robert Downey Jr. persona would find it difficult to get away with weighty, profound statements (in an "entertainment," anyway--a more serious film like "<a href=#>Zodiac</a>" is another matter). Some superheroes speak in a kind of heightened, semi-formal prose, as if dictating to <i>Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.</i> Not Tony Stark. He could talk that way and be Juno's uncle. "Iron Man" doesn't seem to know how seriously most superhero movies take themselves. If there is wit in the dialog, the superhero is often supposed to be unaware of it. If there is broad humor, it usually belongs to the villain. What happens in "Iron Man," however, is that sometimes we wonder how seriously even <i>Stark</i> takes it. He's flippant in the face of disaster, casual on the brink of ruin.</p><p>It's prudent, I think, that Favreau positions the rest of the characters in a more serious vein. The supporting cast wisely does <i>not</i> try to one-up him. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pepper Potts as a woman who is seriously concerned that this goofball will kill himself. Jeff Bridges makes Obadiah Stane one of the great superhero villains by seeming plausibly concerned about the stock price. <a href=#>Terrence Howard</a>, as Col. Rhodes, is at every moment a conventional straight arrow. What a horror show it would have been if they were all tuned to Tony Stark's sardonic wave length. We'd be back in the world of "<a href=#>Swingers</a>" (1996) which was written by Favreau.</p><p>Another of the film's novelties is that the enemy is not a conspiracy or spy organization. It is instead the reality in our own world today: Armaments are escalating beyond the ability to control them. In most movies in this genre, the goal would be to create bigger and better weapons. How unique that Tony Stark wants to disarm. It makes him a superhero who can think, reason and draw moral conclusions, instead of one who recites platitudes.</p><p>The movie is largely founded on its special effects. When somebody isn't talking, something is banging, clanging or laying rubber. The armored robotic suits utilized by Tony and Obadiah would upstage lesser actors than Downey and Bridges; it's surprising how much those two giant iron men seem to reflect the personalities of the men inside them. Everything they do is preposterous, of course, but <i>they</i> seem to be doing it, not the suits. Some of their moments have real grandeur--as when Tony tests his suit to see how high it will fly, and it finally falls back toward earth in a sequence that reminded me of a similar challenge in "<a href=#>The Right Stuff</a>." The art direction is inspired by the original Marvel artists. The movie doesn't reproduce the drawings of <a href=#>Jack Kirby</a> and others, but it reproduces their feeling, a vision of out-scale enormity, seamless sleekness, secret laboratories made not of nuts and bolts but of...vistas.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq6eXmr9uscGeqa1nmae8r3nMmqVmmZ6ZerO7wZ6prWWUpMSvsdhmoaurXabCqr7KsmSpnaKbvLO5wKeang%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ingmar-bergman-godfather-of-horror.html><span>←</span><span>Ingmar Bergman, Godfather of Horror | Roger Ebert</span></a>
