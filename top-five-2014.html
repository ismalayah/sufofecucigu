<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Top Five movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2014)</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>But for all that down-and-dirty business, what I most appreciated about “<span>Top&nbsp;Five” was the very human and adult connection between Rock and <a href=#>Rosario Dawson</a> as a “New York Times” reporter named <a href=#>Chelsea Brown</a>, who is doing a profile on Andre by trailing him for the day.</span></p><p>Most filmmakers barely know how to capitalize on Dawson’s talents other than to fill up the screen with her goddess-like beauty. But Rock treats her single mom who boasts a checkered romantic past along with strong opinions as an equal sparring partner, and even starts the film with a cold opening of the pair strolling the city streets while debating the state of the world.</p><p>Yes, some of the ethical questions involved in this relationship that go beyond the attraction they eventually share end up being quite troubling if not ridiculous. But the palpable natural rapport between the two actors goes a long way to mask such flaws, including Chelsea’s reaction to Andre’s conspiracy theory that the original 1968 “Planet of the Apes” was linked to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.</p><p>“<span>Top&nbsp;Five” also benefits from a parade of cameos, with Rock capitalizing on his considerable showbiz connections to recruit an amazing lineup of name talent in small roles. That includes <a href=#>Kevin Hart</a> as an agent (who provides a short yet pungent phone rant), JB Smoove as a bodyguard/chauffeur, <a href=#>Ben Vereen</a> as Andre’s dad, <a href=#>Sherri Shepherd</a> as his ex-girlfriend and a pre-accident <a href=#>Tracy Morgan</a> as an old acquaintance.&nbsp;</span></p><p>There is a tender undercurrent to the raucous goings-on, which includes the jokester trifecta of <a href=#>Whoopi Goldberg</a>, <a href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a> and Adam Sandler as themselves while attending Andre’s bachelor party at a seedy neon-lit strip club. Eavesdropping on these comics as they discuss the virtues of pre-nups and offer marital tips to the man of honor is pure gold.</p><p>As for the film’s title, it is derived from a party pastime where players rank their all-time favorite rappers along with a sixth alternate. If you were to list "<span>Top&nbsp;Five"’s best surprises, No. 1 might be an appearance by a notorious gangsta rapper with a long history of arrests who croaks <a href=#>Charlie Chaplin</a>’s heartbreaking anthem “<a href=#>Smile</a>” while behind bars.</span></p><p>Earlier, Andre describes Chaplin as one of his influences: “He started this shit—he’s the KRS-One of comedy.” Slapstick and sweetness. Raunch and romance. As a filmmaker, Rock has finally found the yin to go with his yang.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tpqlllp7DpnmRaWht</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stalwart-ability.html><span>←</span><span>Stalwart (Ability) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</span></a>
