She's trying to settle down and play the girlfriend role, but the temptation of trap boys keeps creeping in. The opening verse takes a sexual turn, with Layton singing about a guy whom she is interested in. The second verse includes the perspective of the guy she finds desirable, rapping about how he's a dealer but that shouldn't prevent them from pursuing a relationship. He mentions his sexual prowess and suggests that the others don’t compare to him.</p><br><p>The lyrics in this song imply an addiction to the trap lifestyle and how the desire for money and fast living can be alluring, directly clashing with the longing for a committed, long-term relationship. Layton Greene brings both perspectives to light and suggests that the singer is making a crucial decision to pursue a particular lifestyle at the cost of her connections with men. The repetition of the chorus highlights the central conflict: she's caught up in a lifestyle that presently holds more attraction than conventional relationships.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline
