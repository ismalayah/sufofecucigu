A medicinal analyst decided that Thomas’ demise was an aftereffect of manslaughter, with hypothermia as a significant contributing element.</p><p>The kid’s mom Justyna Zubko-Valva disclosed to CrimeOnline that it was her 10-year-old child Anthony who was in the carport with Thomas that night. The mother said she has been conceded brief care of Anthony and his 6-year-old sibling Andrew.</p><p>The New York Post checked on records demonstrating that New York state’s Office of Children and Family Services got a protest in February 2019 about presumed maltreatment at the home. It is indistinct who documented the objection.</p><p>The mother said that an official with the division “continued disclosing to me that you are permitted to hit your kids.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cause-of-death></span>Cause of Death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The NYPD transit cop accused of murdering his 8-year-old son was heard mocking Thomas Valva the morning after he was forced to sleep in an unheated garage the night before he died.</p><p>As CrimeOnline previously reported, Michael Valva, a 40-year-old NYPD transit officer, and his fiancée, Angela Pollina, 42, were charged with the murder of his 8-year-old son Thomas Valva, who died on January 17 after being forced to spend the night in the unfinished garage when temperatures outside fell to 19 degrees.</p><p>Citing police sources, the New York Post reports that investigators examined audio and video surveillance captured on a home security system, and found recordings of Michael Valva appearing to mock Thomas when he was unable to walk the morning of his death after being left in the garage overnight.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=investigation-report></span>Investigation Report<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Referring to the recordings, Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney Laura Newcombe reportedly said at Valva’s arraignment that Thomas was “face-planting” and another child was heard asking why Thomas couldn’t walk.</p><p>“Because he’s hypothermic,” Pollina reportedly said to the child.</p><p><strong>Jordan Sinnott Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Cause of Death, Career</strong></p><p>“When you wash with cold water and it’s freezing out you become hypothermic.”</p><p>Pollina then reportedly asked Michael Valva why he thought his son couldn’t walk.<br>The recording also reportedly showed that both Thomas Valva, who reportedly had autism, and his brother were left the sleep in the garage without mattresses, blankets, or pillows on the Wednesday before Thomas’s death.</p><p>The New York Post reviewed records showing that New York state’s Office of Children and Family Services received a complaint in February 2019 about suspected abuse at the home. It is unclear who filed the complaint.</p><p>“For the past week, Anthony (9) has been coming to school with his clothes and backpack soaked in urine,” the record reportedly reads.</p><p>“Anthony has been staying in the garage and is not allowed in his room due to him urinating in his bed … Step mother (Angela) and Father (Michael) are aware that the child is arriving at school soiled and fail to adequately address the concern.”</p><p>According to the report, the OCFS closed the complaint after a daylong investigation, citing that it was a “duplicate.”</p><p>Zubko-Valva said she had not seen any of her sons since January 2018, after her ex-husband filed a CPS complaint against her, which she claimed was based on false allegations. As a result, according to Zubko-Vavla, her ex-husband was granted full custody of the children.</p><p>Zubko-Valva said she had made numerous complaints to multiple agencies over the years about her suspicions that her husband was abusing her children. She said when she attempted to file a police report with the Suffolk County Police Department, “they just laughed at me.”</p><p>According to the New York Post, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Geraldine Hart said that authorities attempted to perform at welfare check at the residence in May 2019, but no one was home. The report does not indicate that authorities made a second attempt.</p><p>Thomas’s grieving mother now says she wants to ensure that no other children suffer the way hers did, and is willing to share the documentation of her many attempts to intervene on behalf of her sons “if we can save the life of other children.”</p><p>“I could not understand they protected the abuser of children,” she said. “They did absolutely nothing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyYpLqiv4yvmKWukah6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqnrcKtZJyZopqys3nAsJirnKNirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stranger-things-fans-question-why-one-character-got-their-own-poster.html><span>←</span><span>Stranger Things fans question why one character got their own poster</span></a>
