Killing kids ain’t cool, and we certainly hate him for it.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=491 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Still, Palpatine was just trying to bring “peace” to the galaxy, and as the expression goes: you can’t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. In an infamously cruel move in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Revenge of the Sith</a> Anakin (known hereafter as Darth Vader) makes a direct effort to snuff out the Jedi before they’re even able to realize what’s going on.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>Vader is coerced by Palpatine to carry out these wishes to save his beloved Padmé. Having visions of her death, he is convinced the only way to prevent her demise is to grow as powerful as he possibly can. Then, the Force will keep Padmé safe.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=240 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Order 66</a> didn’t play favorites. Fully trained Jedi were snuffed out in one fell swoop by the Clone troopers that fought alongside them. So, Vader’s killing of the younglings was a more surgical decision than one of cold-blooded passion.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>The irony is that through his obsession, Vader’s love ultimately kills Padmé, leaving the Sith Lord even more misguided and alone. There are, of course, his displaced children Luke and Leia, who grow up to be a real pain in their old man’s side. No wonder the guy hates kids.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>You can’t really come back from killing children though, and in the end Vader’s choice solidifies his chilling persona. It takes someone truly evil to slaughter innocence like that, and audiences everywhere had to accept from then on out that Darth Vader was the real deal.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=162 data-injectable=false>If you’d like to know more about the executive order that brought the Jedi to their knees, check out the video essay below detailing the covert operation.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=462 data-injectable=false></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGxXZm2pXnAp5ikoZ5iuKq4y2aroZ1drry2usaloKefo2K2r3nSrZirZaeWv7R7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sonal-bhatt-arshvir-kaur-bajwa-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-338187-html.html><span>←</span><span>Sonal Bhatt Arshvir Kaur Bajwa Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram,</span></a>
