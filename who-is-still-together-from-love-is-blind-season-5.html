Izzy was rejected by Stacey at the finale weddings after saying “I do” because Stacy still had an issue with his poor credit score (or, more specifically, how long it took him to tell her about it). The pair remained on bad terms for a full year, during which Izzy’s father passed away and he ignored Stacy’s text check-ins. They’re on better terms now, having run into each other at a bar and talked things out. But Johnie revealed at the reunion that she and Izzy reignited their flame during that off-year between Izzy and Stacy. It was a small thing, and it didn’t last long, but it was what we Jizzy stans needed to rest our heads easy on our pillows that night.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true>Obviously, that means Johnie and Chris didn’t wind up together, to the shock of no one. Chris is now dating someone entirely separate from the show, as is Johnie.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>In keeping with couples who haven’t lasted, JP/Taylor and Aaliyah/Uche are also broken up, which again, is not surprising in the least, especially given JP/Taylor’s awful Mexico trip and well, Uche just being Uche; he didn’t even show up to the reunion because he knew everyone on the cast disliked him.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=110 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>So, that leaves — *mentally does quick math* — one couple left standing. You only get one guess who it is.</p><h2 id=h-the-only-couple-still-together-is data-injectable=false>The only couple still together is…&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lydia-and-Milton-on-Love-is-Blind-season-5.jpeg><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>That’s right — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Milton</a> and Lydia are still happily married! They’re the only couple from Love is Blind season 5 who are still together, let alone married. Here’s a tissue for your tears (I mean that sincerely, because either you’re elated by the news or not).&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>It’s true that Lydia’s big personality caused a divide among viewers, but it can’t be argued that Milton’s calm, level-headedness is the yin to her yang. The pair are in love whether you like it or not; they even did the whole shebang over again with a second wedding in Puerto Rico.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=false>I don’t know about you but Milton and Lydia were the last couple I thought would be left standing at the outset of season 5. Let’s not forget Milton was initially a hard “no” for Lydia because of his age. The fact that they’re in love and happily together is proof that Love is Blind, for all its faults, still has a few more Cupid arrows in its arsenal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlo6m2rbiMraagnaSdsrN5xaumpmWcpMOmecisZJukmaOxbr%2FEmqqopl1qfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-chuck-berry-see-net-worth-quote-awards-fact-wiki.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Chuck Berry?
