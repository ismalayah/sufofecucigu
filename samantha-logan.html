<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>All American Cast, Samantha Logan Mysterious Love With Boyfriend, Dylan Sprayberry; Why Isn't The Pi</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Samantha Logan</strong> is the actress from <i>CW</i>'s <i>All American</i> and <i>ABC</i>'s <i>666 Park Avenue. </i>She has been acting since she was <i>13</i> years old, appearing in various movies and TV shows.&nbsp;</p><p>Samantha was born on <i>October 27, 1996</i>, in Boston, Massachusetts, in the United States of America. Her father is of Trinidadian descent, and her mother is of Irish descent. She has attended <i>Professional Performing Arts School for musical theater</i> for middle school. Further, she attended &nbsp;<i>Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts</i> for High School.</p><h2>Relationship with Dylan?</h2><p>Samantha met her boyfriend, <strong>Dylan Sprayberry</strong>,<strong> </strong>in the sets of <i>CW</i>'s <i>Teen Wolf</i>. The two were hired together in the fourth season of the show. It must have been fate that the two would meet and fall in love while working together in just one episode.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/6/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(10)-1580979450122.jpg><p>She shared the above picture in the Christmas of<i> 2018</i>, which has the caption "2013 -> 2018". It shows that the couple had been together for five years at that point. The lovely couple shared pictures of each other frequently on social media. She uploaded a photo of them doing pottery together and wrote&nbsp;</p><p>"Happy Valentine’s Day ❤️<br>I love this goober so much it hurts"</p><p>This showed the love they have for each other. But tragedy struck when the couple seemingly broke up. The couple hasn't uploaded any pictures of each other for over a year, and Logan unfollowed Dylan on Instagram. &nbsp;</p><p>The break up seems to be on good terms because she hasn't deleted any pictures of them together. The couple were together for so long and were so into each other it's sad to see them apart.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>The <i>23</i>-year-old actress from Boston has an estimated net worth of <strong>$525,000</strong>, which she earns from her acting career. The emerging actress has bagged many good roles in major productions in her young career.&nbsp;</p><p>The actress made her debut in <i>2009</i> from <i>Gossip Girl</i>.

The same year, she also appeared in a movie <i>Detachment </i>along-side <strong>Adrien Brody</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/6/Samantha%20Logan%20net%20worth%20and%20properties%20(1)-1580984279253.jpg><p>In addition to her property, she also owns a brand new BMW car.

She is quite fond of experiencing different cultures and places.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/6/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(11)-1580979632487.jpg><p>The actress has posted pictures of her traveling to places like Paris, Indonesia, Poland, Spain, and Peru. She is even seen learning the culture and bonding with the locals. She also does some volunteering works, as seen in the picture above in Peru.</p><h2>Career Kickoff</h2><p>In <i>2012,</i> she was cast as Nona Clark in <i>ABC</i>'s show <i>666 Park Avenue </i>for six episodes. This role was an excellent platform to take-off. She landed a role in the long-running <i>General Hospital</i> as Taylor DuBois for <i>13</i> episodes. She appeared alongside <a href=#><strong>Ignacio Serricchio,</strong></a> <strong>Gene Francis,</strong> <a href=#><strong>Kelly Monaco</strong></a>, and<strong> Maurice Bernard</strong>, among others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2020/2/6/Webp.net-resizeimage%20(12)-1580980037227.jpg><p>The young actress played<strong> </strong>Heather in <i>2014</i>'s "<i>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day" </i>alongside <strong>Steve Carell</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Garner,</strong> and <strong>Ed Oxenbould</strong>.
