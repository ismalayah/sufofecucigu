NAPERVILLE, Ill. (WLS) — Neighbors are helping neighbors clean up after the strong EF-3 tornado whipped through Naperville, Woodridge, Darien, and Burr Ridge Sunday night. Naperville police kept watch all night to make sure the area remains safe.
One house was reduced to rubble. Amazingly, though there is damage to homes on either side, those homes are still standing. That’s an example of the random nature of this storm.

<a href=../../../../ingmar-bergman-godfather-of-horror.html></a>
Jason Matherne, my DP and a film maker from New Orleans who makes unruly and despicable (but funny) gore movies, showed me his new film, "Goregasm," recently. While we were watching, he continually pointed out shots and lighting effects that he attributed to "Hour of the Wolf," "Fanny and Alexander," and "Shame"! As it turns out, he bought most of the Bergman DVDs and, indeed, studies them. So Woody Allen isn't the only one inspired by these films; a twenty-five year old goth boy with a Canon XL1 is inspired to reach beyond himself, too.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>&amp;quot;Iron Man&amp;quot; and Robert Downey Jr.'s quirky performance | Roger Ebert</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>

There are some things that some actors can safely say onscreen, and other things they can't. The Robert Downey Jr. persona would find it difficult to get away with weighty, profound statements (in an "entertainment," anyway--a more serious film like "Zodiac" is another matter). Some superheroes speak in a kind of heightened, semi-formal prose, as if dictating to Bartlett's Familiar Quotations. Not Tony Stark. He could talk that way and be Juno's uncle.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Cinthia Montero Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../90s-live-action-super-mario-bros-movie-20-minutes-longer.html></a>
1993’s&nbsp;Super Mario Bros. is a notorious cinematic disaster, but if you want to revisit it, there’s now an extended cut available on the Internet Archive for free.
Recommended Videos Starring Bob Hoskins as Mario, John Leguizamo as Luigi and Dennis Hopper as Koopa, it’s considered a terribly conceived adaptation that reimagines the cute and cuddly game series as a hellish cyberpunk dystopia. The stories of its production have become legendary, from the stars spending the shoot getting extremely drunk together, renegade directorial team Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel going way off-piste and Nintendo finding the whole experience so off-putting that they abandoned Hollywood for decades.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What is Jenna Ortegas net worth?</h2><time>Aug 25, 2024</time>
