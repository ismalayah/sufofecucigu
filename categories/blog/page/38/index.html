Tracy is embodied by Reese Witherspoon, an actress I've admired since she had her first kiss in "The Man in the Moon" (1991), and who moved up to adult roles in "Freeway" (1997), a harrowing retelling of "Little Red Riding Hood" with Kiefer Sutherland as the wolf. She was a virginal headmaster's daughter in "Cruel Intentions," which opened last month but she hits her full stride in "Election" as an aggressive, manipulative vixen who informs a teacher she hopes they can work together "</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jonathan Liebesman movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</h2><time>May 10, 2024</time>

<a href=../../../../what-is-the-bachelor-contestant-lea-cayanans-guilty-pleasure.html></a>
Lea Cayanan&nbsp;was a standout on night one of&nbsp;The Bachelor, earning the coveted&nbsp;First Impression Rose&nbsp;from&nbsp;Joey Graziadei&nbsp;himself, despite there being 32 women — the most in the history of The Bachelor franchise — to choose from. Recommended Videos While things seemed to be smooth sailing between Lea and Joey, things took a turn for the worse in episode 2 when she failed to hear her name on a date card. Since then, she has embarked on only group dates — failing to receive as much screen time as some of the other contestants — ultimately leaving fans of The Bachelor franchise with dozens and dozens of questions about who she is beyond the television show.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Exclusive interview: The Last of Us showrunners valued realism over perfection</h2><time>May 9, 2024</time>

As beautiful as the world of HBO’s The Last of Us is, it’s also a painstakingly realistic take on how the world would hypothetically look if society collapsed and the vast majority of humanity ceased to exist.
Recommended Videos This look is something that showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann were extremely meticulous about when overseeing the design of the show’s visual effects, as revealed in a recent conversation we had with one of the VFX studios behind the The Last of Us, DNEG – who were responsible for realizing the show’s post-apocalyptic cityscapes.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Longmire Confidently Returns on Netflix | TV/Streaming</h2><time>May 9, 2024</time>

It’s not long into the three episodes of “Longmire” made available for press when something dawned on me—like a General Manager filling a weak position on his team, Netflix picked up “Longmire” to fill a need. They don’t really have a show like it. We’ve kind of been assuming that sturdy, reliable, mystery shows of the variety that generally appeal to older viewers and people with USA in their Favorite Channels queue (think “CSI,” “Law & Order,” “Monk”) don’t really fit with streaming services and binge viewing.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Algee Smith Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</h2><time>May 8, 2024</time>
