Walsh thought of the part as a modern spin on the kinds of parts Sidney Greenstreet used to play, but Greenstreet was good company, even when playing bastards. You wouldn’t want to be with the detective for the length of an elevator ride. He has the wheezing laugh of a chimpanzee and a demon’s leer, and yet the miraculous thing is you start to suspect that the violence he’s willing to commit is a last resort.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kindergarten Cop Pulled From Drive-In After Complaints That Its Racist</h2><time>Sep 2, 2024</time>

After being declared dead in Iraq, it's discovered he's alive after all, and Jack is returned to the States and treated for amnesia. Out on his own, he's hitching through Vermont when he comes upon a spaced-out mother (Kelly Lynch) and her worried young daughter; their car has broken down.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Your thoughts on the Galar region?</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>
