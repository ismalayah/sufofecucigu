But who are the Alamites, and where have you seen them before?</p><h2 id=h-what-are-the-alamites data-injectable=false>What are the Alamites?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=212 data-current-count=212 data-injectable=false>If you can’t remember seeing the Alamites before, don’t worry, “Chapter 18: The Mines of Mandalore” is the first time the creatures have appeared in the&nbsp;Star Wars&nbsp;universe.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true>Because of this, all we know of them is what we’ve seen and what Bo-Katan said while traveling across Mandalore. She explained that the Alamites were an alien race native to Mandalore. But, due to the Mandalorian domination of the planet, they were forced to live in the wastelands between cities. However, once the planet was purged and the Mandalorian people left, the Alamites took over the land – leading to its current state.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=130 data-injectable=false>Of course, Bo-Katan could be wrong, but viewers must wait for future episodes of&nbsp;The Mandalorian&nbsp;to discover more.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-why-do-the-alamites-look-so-familiar data-injectable=false>Why do the Alamites look so familiar?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=430 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>Once the episode aired, many people took to social media to point out that the Alamites look similar to the Morlocks from the 1960 film adaptation of the 1895 H.G. Wells story&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Time Machine</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true>Of course, fans have wondered if this is more than a simple visual nod. In the 1960 movie, a man from 1900 travels forward in time to 802,701. At this time, society is split into two. The passive, tranquil Eloi, who know nothing of their history, and the monstrous Morlocks, who live under the surface. However, all is not as it seems, as it is revealed that the Morlocks are actually raising the Eloi like cattle so they can eat them.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>Could&nbsp;The Mandalorian&nbsp;be setting up a similar twist? Maybe the relationship between the former inhabitants of Mandalore and the Alamites isn’t as cut and dry as Bo-Katan said. Or maybe the Alamites are not the only creatures living on Mandalore, and something else lurks in the shadows, using these monstrous beings as part of a grander plan.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=false>Of course, it could simply be a shout-out to a slice of classic sci-fi, or a massive coincidence. Fans will have to wait and see.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJqqlWLBqbGMmqOapZmpsrR5yKdkraCVYrqiusOao6iqmZa7cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bobbie-jean-carter.html><span>←</span><span>Bobbie Jean Carter</span></a>
