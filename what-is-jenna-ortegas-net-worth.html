She played a young Jane in Jane the Virgin, Princess Isabel in the Elena of Avalor releases, and took on several background roles in films like Iron Man 3 and Insidious: Chapter 2. By the early 2020s, she’d graduated from these early-career staples and moved on to bigger roles.</p><p data-characters=628 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>It was her role as Wednesday Addams in Wednesday that made Ortega a household name, but she’s far from finished. Wednesday was just the start of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ortega’s new peak period</a>, which is prepped to see the 21-year-old in a slew of highly-anticipated releases. She’s slated to appear in nearly a half dozen projects over the next few years alone, with a few — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">like Beetlejuice 2</a>&nbsp;and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Death of a Unicorn</a>&nbsp;— stirring up particular hype. Ortega is still at the very start of her career — despite those 10 years of experience under her belt — but she’s already got a solid financial cushion to fall back on.</p><h2 id=h-jenna-ortega-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>Jenna Ortega’s net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jenna_Ortega.jpg><p data-characters=316 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>There’s a lot of money in moviemaking, and Jenna Ortega is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly becoming a Hollywood go-to</a>. Her bank account is already far larger than that of most Americans, and — with a lengthy career ahead of her — the young actress is likely to out-earn some of Hollywood’s favorites within just a few years.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=false>She’s by no means among the best-paid women in Hollywood, but that might change once Ortega properly gets her claws in. The 21-year-old is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">already worth a good $5 million</a>, just from those early-career success stories, and she’s got decades of work ahead of her. If $5 million is, essentially, her starting point, it’s mind-boggling to consider how much the talented young star will be worth by the time she hits 30.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZqau6%2BtjKiprZ2XlsBuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./90s-live-action-super-mario-bros-movie-20-minutes-longer.html><span>←</span><span>Watch: Super Mario Bros.
