The latest God of War outing concluded the Norse chapter of Kratos’ lengthy saga, bringing the story started in 2018’s God of War to a fitting conclusion.
Recommended Videos The visually stunning title brought Kratos and his son, Atreus, against several of the most recognizable figures in Norse mythology. As they cut their way through the Nine Realms, the father-son duo found themselves pitted against some of the most recognizable — and most dangerous — gods from Norse mythology.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Dont drink Oprahs Kool-Aid: The insidious nature of new Maui wildfire relief fund is bei</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson have landed themselves on the internet’s list of hated celebrities, and it’s for a reason that some might call altruistic. For the people impacted by the Maui Wildfires, however, their recent stunt is seen as less compassionate and more insidious. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href=../../../the-storms-of-jeremy-thomas-movie-review-2023.html></a>
Cousins' narration gets a bit MFA fiction workshop&nbsp;at certain points, but that's a&nbsp;feature of his work, not a bug (in another life, he might've been a novelist, possibly&nbsp;in a Beat writer mode). The film is organized around storms and divided into numbered&nbsp;chapters with titles like "Sex" and "Death." It gets a bit fanboyish when delving into the sexual and political content of Thomas' projects. Cousins accounts for this by noting that his own tastes were partly formed by watching Thomas' movies.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What does Mariah Brown do for a living?</h2><time>Jul 4, 2024</time>

The Eleventh Doctor’s costume has to be one of the most iconic outfits in&nbsp;Doctor Who.&nbsp;With the tweed jacket and bow tie, it’s probably as instantly recognizable to casual fans as Tom Baker’s classic hat and scarf combo. As with most things, though, this Doctor’s fashion sense didn’t arrive fully formed and there was actually a long costuming process before star Matt Smith and the production team could agree on a unique look for the character.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Joe Root Bio, Facts, Wiki, Net Worth, Age, Height, Family, ICC World Cup 2019, Shakib, Eoin, Sta</h2><time>Jul 2, 2024</time>

10 years ago, Taylor Kitsch had been positioned as Hollywood’s next major blockbuster leading man-in-waiting. In the space of a few weeks, the rising star took top billing in Disney’s mega budget sci-fi John Carter, and Peter Berg’s questionable board game adaptation Battleship. Unfortunately, things did not end up going too well.

<a href=../../../time-bandits-1981.html></a>
“Time Bandits” is the expensive fantasy by Terry Gilliam, one of the resident geniuses of Monty Python's Flying Circus. It is not a Monty Python film. It begins with a little boy who goes up to bed one night and is astonished, as we all would be, when a horseman gallops through his bedroom wall and he is in the middle of a pitched battle. Before long, the little kid has joined up with a band of six intrepid dwarfs, and they've embarked on an odyssey through history.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/22/>← Prev Page</a>
