As with most things, though, this Doctor’s fashion sense didn’t arrive fully formed and there was actually a long costuming process before star Matt Smith and the production team could agree on a unique look for the character.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>At Fan Expo Canada, which took place this past weekend, Smith revealed that he was originally set to don a very different outfit, before the suggestion of a certain type of neckwear made everything click into place:</p><p>“I tried so many costumes on and at&nbsp;first&nbsp;he was quite pirate-y—he was in stripes and like a long coat and he looked a bit like Johnny Depp in&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean. Once we got the whole costume on, it felt like something was missing and I was like, ‘Can I try a bow tie on?’ and Steven Moffat was like ‘No, you can’t wear a bow tie’ but I tried it on and suddenly it sort of lifted the whole outfit.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/d11-11h-021.jpg alt width=1280 height=699 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p data-characters=140 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>As for the tweed jacket, that actually came from Smith’s own suggestion, as he thought it would be perfect for his take on the Doctor:</p><p>“For the first meeting, I went in a tweed blazer, which is why he wears a tweed blazer. I thought, ‘Well, he’s old, so I’ve got to make him feel kind of professorial.'”</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately, this had the knock-on affect of ensuring that the actor couldn’t wear any tweed out in public ever again – lest it look like he was cosplaying as his own character.</p><p>“I had a tweed blazer which I loved and which, obviously, I can never wear again. I was really annoyed at the time because I thought I looked really cool in it.”</p><p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>We imagine that Smith would agree it’s worth it, though. Thanks to the Eleventh Doctor, hundreds of <strong>Doctor Who&nbsp;</strong>fans now know the joys of wearing tweed when they cosplay as the Time Lord at conventions. Plus, he single handedly made bow ties “cool.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurdOtZKylmam1brvRop6ipqNisbCv06ipZq%2BYpHqku9KtrKadXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-milly-shapiro-related-to-ben-shapiro-her-face-condition-explained.html><span>←</span><span>Is Milly Shapiro Related To Ben Shapiro?
