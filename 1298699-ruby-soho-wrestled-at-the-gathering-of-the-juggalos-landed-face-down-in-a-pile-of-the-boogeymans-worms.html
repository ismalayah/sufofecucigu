When asked about working the Gathering of the Juggalo events back in the day, Soho shared some funny stories about those experiences.</p><p>“I participated at the Gathering of the Juggalos for a few years,” Ruby Soho said. “It was definitely one of the most interesting experiences I’ve ever had in my life. I had never wrestled at 2:30 in the morning before and, at one point, my tam team partner that I was tagging with at the time was asleep when our music hit. He’s in the chair, just passed out and I’m like. ‘Dude, we got to go.’ And he’s like, ‘what?’ I said, ‘Our music is hitting? We got to go.’ So that was obviously an experience.</p><p>“A memory I have from it is I wrestled at 2:30 in the morning. I wrestled my former tag team partner, Sarah Rowe, and she dove on me on the outside and we had wrestled right after The Boogeyman. So I was face down in a pile of live earthworms that were previously out there. Those are one of those moments where you’re like, ‘It’s 2:30 in the morning. I am facedown in a pile of earthworms, I might be in an interesting industry and you rethink every decision you’ve made up until that point. You’re getting Faygo thrown at you like the whole nine yards. You just rethink everything that you’ve done. But it was a very interesting experience. I had a lot of fun, but it was a wild one. It was unlike anything I’ve ever been a part of for sure.”</p><p>Ruby Soho spoke with WrestleZone ahead of Double Or Nothing about her chemistry with Toni Storm, her experience on&nbsp;Carpool Karaoke&nbsp;and more;&nbsp;you can check out that interview by clicking <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a>.</p><p>What do you make of Ruby Soho’s comments?
