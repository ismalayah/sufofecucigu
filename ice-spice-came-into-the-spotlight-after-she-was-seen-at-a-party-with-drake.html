Her father was an underground rapper, she once said. More information regarding her educational history, financial wealth, and personal life are yet unknown.&nbsp;Ice Spice spent the most of her life inside due to the high crime rate in the Bronx at the time. She ultimately became obsessed to television and YouTube and decided that when she grew up, she wanted to be a renowned celebrity.&nbsp;The artist hopes to perform Latin music in addition to working on some Spanish tracks.</p><h2>Ice Spice has released a little video for Munch (Feeling U).</h2><p>On August 15, 2022, Ice Spice released a new video for her song Munch (Feelin’ U). The words of the song describe her feelings regarding dishonest men, disliking women, and other topics.&nbsp;Spice was seen dancing with a group of friends and fans at numerous locations across the Bronx, including a park, in front of Paya Deli, and during a photoshoot. Following its debut, the song garnered a great reception.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Drake-1.jpeg alt=Drake width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><br>Drake, on the other hand, praised Spice’s music in an Instagram DM.
