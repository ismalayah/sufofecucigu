One caller asked Bryan Alvarez during <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Live</a> what WWE’s endgame is for hiring&nbsp;Shafir and Duke and his response was quite exciting.</p><p>“I don’t know if it’s this Survivor Series but down the road you will see the 4 Horsewomen vs the 4 Horsewomen.”</p><p>This is an example of long-term&nbsp;booking in the most basic sense. It looks like WWE is preparing for a big match down the road. Because no matter when it happens, an 8-woman match like that will look good on a marquee&nbsp;and is likely to sell plenty of tickets..</p><p>If you use our quotes credit <a href=#>Ringside News</a></p><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS.
