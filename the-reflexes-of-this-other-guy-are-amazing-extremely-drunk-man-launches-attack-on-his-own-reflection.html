But while that is unfortunately the norm in a volatile situation such as the one mentioned, what is certainly unexpected is when a fight breaks out between one drunken man and himself. Specifically, with himself and the man directly in the mirror — and yes, we mean his legitimate reflection.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=456 data-current-count=456 data-injectable=true>This gut-busting scenario was accurately depicted over on <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a></strong>, where a user shared a head-scratching moment where a drunken man was punching and striking his reflection in a bar mirror. The entire idea of literally fighting yourself seems incredibly silly, but when you consider the fact this man must have had a few vodka and tonics to even get in this position, then it doesn’t seem that surprising that he could barely recognize his own reflection.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@zappeddaddy href=#>@zappeddaddy</a><p>Hey tough guy, you talking to me?!</p><a title="♬ Do you wanna fight meeee by FluffyBaee - FluffyBaee" href=#>♬ Do you wanna fight meeee by FluffyBaee – FluffyBaee</a></figure><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>The true kicker of the video is a memed version of a song from Frozen playing over the video’s original sound while two bros in a bar pose and giggle to themselves as we see the drunk guy in the background punching the mirror. From fellow TikTokers quoting Michael Jackson’s “Man in the Mirror” to others joking about a battle with yourself being the toughest obstacle in life, the comment section definitely provided endless humor.</p><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=false>As humorous as the video truly is, the aggression displayed by the drunken man is certainly no surprise seeing as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol often triggers our cognitive</a> control and results in an aggressive nature. So while the situation in real time absolutely makes us shake our heads and laugh, the truth is that there are serious consequences to ingesting too much alcohol. Stay safe out there when you drink, friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tbTEZqmenpyaxaa%2FjKidZqyYnsBuu9OhnKtll6rGbq3RnmSapZGvtq%2BzjJ6vraqVorKtxYydqa6mm2K6orqMpZiuppOdsrR5wK2rmpubYryveceiqmanp6N6s7HFpZycrJmku3A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pedro-tovar-20020722-html.html><span>←</span><span>Pedro Tovar (World Music Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</span></a>
