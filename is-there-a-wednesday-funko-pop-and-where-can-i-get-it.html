With that being said, the desire for fans of the series to own a Wednesday-inspired figure is just as rampant as when the show first debuted on Netflix.</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-wednesday-funko-pop data-injectable=false>Is there a Wednesday Funko Pop?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/wednesday-jenna-ortega.jpg><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Devoted fans of the hit series will be ecstatic to know that there is indeed a Wednesday Funko Pop — although it has yet to be officially released to the public. That’s right, the item is currently listed as a pre-order, which means folks that purchase the figure will have to wait until it’s fully released by its makers. Still, it’s certainly a positive sign that the Funko Pop is on the way, which could also mean that future Wednesday-themed Funkos will be made available somewhere down the line.</p><h2 id=h-where-can-i-get-it data-injectable=false>Where can I get it?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/wednesday-funko.png><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>As previously mentioned, the figure is currently available only in the pre-order stage, where it can be purchased through sites such as Amazon, ToyPlace, and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official Funko website</a>. The aesthetically-pleasing Funko is listed at a variety of different prices depending on which website it’s ordered from, but passionate fans will still be happy to learn that the option for pre-order is on the table.</p><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false>Combine this with the news of Wednesday and the clan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">returning for a second season</a>, and it’s been an absolutely thrilling day for Addams Family fanatics. Until you get your paws on this Funko, be sure to watch the first season of Wednesday in its entirety on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ytn56qlWKubsPEnaWeq5SWxm6y1KeiqGWgpL1urc2dZLCglaeybq%2FAp2SiZZeawW6102g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./anime-streaming-service-hidive-to-exit-partnership-with-vrv.html><span>←</span><span>Anime Streaming Service HIDIVE To Exit Partnership With VRV</span></a>
