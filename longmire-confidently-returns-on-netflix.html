They don’t really have a show like it. We’ve kind of been assuming that sturdy, reliable, mystery shows of the variety that generally appeal to older viewers and people with USA in their Favorite Channels queue (think “CSI,” “Law & Order,” “Monk”) don’t really fit with streaming services and binge viewing. Netflix and Amazon have clearly been cribbing from HBO and Showtime in their novel-esque approach to television. But that doesn’t mean that a well-done “mystery of the week” series <i>couldn’t</i> work in this format. Actually, watching “Longmire,” I realized how well suited this kind of show is for a streaming service. With a show like “House of Cards,” you know one more episode really isn’t going to resolve anything. With a show like “Longmire,” it’s always going to be tempting to watch just “one more mystery.”</p><p>And what’s surprising about these three episodes is how cleanly the creators interweave standalone stories with an overall arc. About that arc—I can’t really say much. It feels like even saying which characters have made the transition from cable television to Netflix—and which ones have not—is a bit of spoiler. Suffice to say, the three leads are the same. The show is led by the perfectly-cast <a href=#>Robert Taylor</a> as Walt Longmire, the Sheriff of Absaroka County, an area of Wyoming with a rich history and a large Native American population. His deputy and most loyal partner is Vic Moretti (<a href=#>Katee Sackhoff</a>), although Henry Standing Bear (<a href=#>Lou Diamond Phillips</a>) is arguably his most reliable confidant.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/55ea4d3ccd3b5622a700008c/longm_ps4_049_h.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At the end of season three, Walt discovered who was behind his wife’s murder, a nefarious local businessman named Jacob Nighthorse (A. Martinez). Season four picks up right there, with an angry Longmire going after Nighthorse, while Henry tries to stop him from doing something he’ll regret. Over the next three episodes, the Longmire-Nighthorse drama serves as backdrop to a tragedy, a real mystery that will push Longmire even deeper into obsession and depression. The writers do a marvelous job of pushing their multi-episode arc forward while also taking time for new cases, such as a brilliantly executed one in episode two in which a body is found at an old Japanese Internment Camp. That mystery even thematically ties into the rest of the series in that it’s about how we don’t really know the people we think we do.</p><p>It sometimes sounds like faint praise to describe a series like you would a reliable car but “Longmire” is just a sturdy show. It is well-constructed all around—confidently made, well-acted, and the writing is much smarter than many shows like it. It hums, each episode these three feeling more well-paced than the one before. Actually, my comparisons to mysteries on networks like CBS and USA may not have been fair. “Longmire” is better than any of those.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZqWnnpy6qr7EZpqoppaesaa606WwZqqVqcKzutJmpqdlnprBp7jIsQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./exclusive-interview-the-last-of-us-showrunners-valued-realism-over-perfection.html><span>←</span><span>Exclusive interview: The Last of Us showrunners valued realism over perfection</span></a>
